# HOW TO IMPLEMENT

Well this bot's not designed for your average squeaker's Discord server. 

The bot is designed for a person that has a little python coding knowledge and computer knowledge in general.

the bot does not have a version that runs constantly on some server somewhere you have to run it yourself

because of its storage requirements and the way everything is implemented.

so why do you implement this preferably you going to run it on a Linux machine

just plop it into the home directory and run the boot.sh script

and also run gconf python script to set up the token to your own bot




you probably don't want to run it on Windows preferably you want to run it on a arch box or something running Arch base Linux
